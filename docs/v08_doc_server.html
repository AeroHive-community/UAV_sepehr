<h1>Drone Simulation Server Setup Guide 0.8</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to the Drone Simulation Server Setup Guide. This document aims to provide a comprehensive set of instructions to set up your own drone simulation server, based on the <code>mavsdk_drone_show</code> GitHub repository. The repository was created in September 2023 and is based on version 0.8 of the original project.</p>

<p>For a step-by-step walkthrough from version 0.1, you can follow our YouTube tutorial playlist. Links to these tutorials are available in the <a href="https://github.com/alireza787b/mavsdk_drone_show">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<h2>Resource Allocation</h2>

<p>The minimum resource allocation required for running two drone instances is 2 CPU cores and 4 GB of RAM.</p>
<p>For testing, start with at least 2 CPUs and 4GB RAM. Increase proportional to the number of drones being simulated.</p>
<p>Each drone instance requires significant compute for SITL, so plan accordingly. A good starting point is 1 core and 1GB RAM per drone.</p>

<h2>Initial Server Setup</h2>

<p>Create a Virtual Machine (VM) based on your requirements. For example, using Linode, choose sufficient resources based on the number of drones you want to simulate. Recommended OS: Ubuntu 22.04.</p>


<h3>Pointing a Domain or Subdomain (Optional)</h3>

<p>Although it's optional, it's highly recommended to point a domain or subdomain to your drone server for ease of access and identification. You can use your existing domain or purchase a new one.</p>

<p><strong>Role of Cloudflare in This Project:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>DNS Management:</strong> The primary role Cloudflare will serve in this project is as a DNS (Domain Name System) management service. DNS is the mechanism that translates human-friendly domain names into IP addresses where servers are hosted.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple Configuration:</strong> Cloudflare offers an easy-to-use interface for pointing your domain or subdomain to your server IP.</li>
  <li><strong>No Proxy:</strong> For this setup, we turn off Cloudflare's proxy feature, ensuring that Cloudflare only serves as a DNS manager and does not interfere with your server configurations or data traffic.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Setting Up Cloudflare:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare's website</a> and sign up for a free account if you don't have one already.</li>
  <li>After logging in, click on 'Add a Site' to add your domain to Cloudflare.</li>
  <li>Follow the on-screen instructions to verify ownership and import existing DNS settings (if applicable).</li>
  <li>Once the domain is added, proceed to the DNS management section.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>How to Add an A Record in Cloudflare:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Log in to your Cloudflare account if you are not already logged in.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the 'DNS' tab.</li>
  <li>Click on 'Add Record.'</li>
  <li>Select 'A' in the 'Type' dropdown.</li>
  <li>Enter 'drone' in the 'Name' field to create a subdomain like <code>drone.yourdomain.com</code>.</li>
  <li>Enter your server IP address in the 'IPv4 Address' field.</li>
  <li>Ensure the 'Proxy Status' is set to 'DNS Only.'</li>
  <li>Click 'Save.'</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note on Security and Accessibility:</strong> It is advisable to use a reverse proxy, such as Nginx or Caddy web servers, to manage and secure access to your server's various services like the dashboard and Portainer. A reverse proxy can help you configure SSL certificates for these subdomains, ensuring encrypted and secure communication. This setup not only enhances security but also improves access management, allowing you to point several subdomains to different services seamlessly.</p>

<p>For detailed guides on setting up a reverse proxy with SSL certificates, please refer to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/" target="_blank">Nginx Documentation</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/" target="_blank">Caddy Documentation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Tip: If you prefer, you can also continue to use the IP address of the server or your main domain and port number or Reverse DNS URLs.</p>


<h2>Server Configuration: Basic Setup</h2>
<h3>Access to your server using SSH</h3>
<pre>
<code>
ssh root@your_server_ip
</code></pre>

<h3>Package and Software Installation</h3>

<pre><code>
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip
</code></pre>

<p>First, ensure that your system package list and Python3 pip package are up-to-date by running the above commands.</p>

<h4>Installing Mediafire Downloader</h4>

<p>Install the Mediafire downloader to fetch the specialized drone image:</p>

<pre><code>
pip3 install git+https://github.com/Juvenal-Yescas/mediafire-dl
</code></pre>

<h4>Downloading the Custom Drone Image</h4>

<p>In your home directory, download the latest image:</p>

<pre><code>
mediafire-dl https://www.mediafire.com/file/8i54nkdxt3abkd2/drone-template-1_19thsept2023.tar/file
</code></pre>

<p>This image is a fully-functional, ready-to-use drone instance. Details and customization options will be described in the next section.</p>



<h3>Docker Installation</h3>

<pre>
<code>
sudo apt install docker.io
</code></pre>

<p>Load the downloaded image into Docker:</p>

<pre>
<code>
sudo docker load &lt; drone-template-1_19thsept2023.tar
</code></pre>

<h5>Image Features and Components</h5>

<p>This custom image is a plug-and-play solution built on Ubuntu 22.04. It includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PX4 1.13</li>
  <li>mavsdk_drone_show</li>
  <li>mavlink-router</li>
  <li>Gazebo</li>
  <li>SITL</li>
  <li>All other necessary dependencies</li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, it has an auto hardware ID detection and instance creation system for automated drone instance creation.</p>

<h4>Customizing the Docker Image (Optional)</h4>

<p>If you are experienced with Docker and Git and wish to customize the Docker image for specific project needs or to test new features, here's a brief guide:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Container Setup:</strong> Create and start a Docker container from the existing drone template image to serve as your modification workspace.</li>
  <li><strong>Repository Management:</strong> Fork the <code>mavsdk_drone_show</code> repository and clone your fork into the Docker container. This setup allows you to make changes without impacting the original codebase.</li>
  <li><strong>Branch Management:</strong> Create new branches or switch between existing ones within your repository to manage different development streams or feature tests.</li>
  <li><strong>Software Integration:</strong> Add any required components such as the MAVSDK_Server or other dependencies that are crucial for your project's functionality.</li>
  <li><strong>Image Customization:</strong> Once your modifications are complete, commit the changes to a new Docker image to preserve your environment for future deployments.</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach ensures you have a Docker image customized to your requirements, ready for deploying drone simulations or other related applications. Utilize your expertise in Docker and Git to manage and implement these changes efficiently.</p>

	    
<h3>Portainer Installation (Optional but Highly Recommended)</h3>

<p>Portainer is an open-source management tool that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate the management and monitoring of Docker environments. It simplifies the deployment, troubleshooting, and overall control of Docker containers, including those used for drone simulations.</p>

<pre><code>
# Create a volume for Portainer data to ensure data persistence.
sudo docker volume create portainer_data

# Run the Portainer container bound to Docker to manage the local Docker environment.
sudo docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9443:9443 --name portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce:latest
</code></pre>

<p>After installation, ensure Portainer is running correctly:</p>

<pre><code>
sudo docker ps
</code></pre>

<p>Once confirmed, you can access Portainer through a web browser, which provides an intuitive dashboard to manage your drone containers. This allows for easy monitoring of container status, direct interaction with logs, and quick modifications of container configurations.</p>

<p>Access Portainer by navigating to:</p>

<pre><code>
https://drone.YOUR_DOMAIN.com:9443
</code></pre>

<p>This URL will take you to the Portainer login page, where you can manage all Docker resources. The visual interface makes it easy to start, stop, and manage your individual drone instances, providing a clear view of your deployments and simplifying complex Docker commands into user-friendly interactions.</p>

	    

<h2>Drone Configuration and Setup</h2>


<h3>Clone Repository and Install Dependencies</h3>
<p>If you have forked the <code>mavsdk_drone_show</code> repository to make custom modifications or to test new features, replace the <code>alireza787b</code> in the clone command below with your own GitHub username of your forked repository.</p>

<pre>
<code>
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/alireza787b/mavsdk_drone_show
cd mavsdk_drone_show
pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>

<h3>Additional Software Installations (Webserver)</h3>

<pre>
<code>
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
</code></pre>

<p>Navigate to the React web server directory and install packages:</p>

<pre>
<code>
cd ~/mavsdk_drone_show/app/dashboard/drone-dashboard
npm install
</code></pre>

<h3>Check Server Functionality</h3>

<pre>
<code>
cd ~/mavsdk_drone_show/app
bash linux_dashboard_start.sh
</code></pre>

<p>You should now be able to access the GUI via a browser using your domain, IP, or reverse DNS URL. eg. <code>http://drone.joomtalk.ir:3000</code></p>
<h3>Mission Configuration and Customization (Optional)</h3>
<p>
  You can configure your mission, swarm design, or drone show using SkyBrush or similar tools. Remember, if you make any changes to these configurations, you should push those changes to your forked GitHub repo. Your drone instances will automatically pull these changes upon startup.
</p>


<h3>VPN Setup for Local MAVLink Communication (Optional but Recommended)</h3>

<p>
  Using a VPN is crucial for securely connecting your devices, including your server and local PC or smartphone. This setup allows you to manage and monitor your drones in real-time through a Ground Control Station (GCS) like QGroundControl. We recommend Netbird for its ease of use, but Tailscale and ZeroTier are also viable options.
</p>

<h4>Why Use a VPN?</h4>
<p>
  VPNs like Netbird, Tailscale, and ZeroTier provide a secure and reliable way to route MAVLink packets between your server and local Ground Control Station. This is preferable to using port forwarding or VNC due to the enhanced security and simpler configuration that VPNs offer.
</p>

<h4>VPN Options and Setup</h4>
<p>
  Depending on your preference and specific needs, you can choose from several VPN solutions. Here’s how to set up each:
</p>

<h5>Netbird Setup</h5>
<p>
  Netbird offers a straightforward setup process:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Install Netbird on both your server and local machine by following the instructions on their <a href="https://docs.netbird.io/how-to/installation">official documentation page</a>.</li>
  <li>Run 'netbird up' to connect each device to the network.</li>
  <li>Verify connectivity by pinging the respective Netbird IP addresses from each device.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Tailscale Setup</h5>
<p>
  If you prefer Tailscale, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Install Tailscale on both your server and local machine using the instructions provided on the <a href="https://tailscale.com/download">Tailscale download page</a>.</li>
  <li>Authenticate and connect each device to your Tailscale network.</li>
  <li>Check the connection by pinging the Tailscale IP addresses.</li>
</ol>

<h5>ZeroTier Setup</h5>
<p>
  ZeroTier can also be used by following these steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download and install ZeroTier on all devices from <a href="https://www.zerotier.com/download/">their website</a>.</li>
  <li>Create a network on the ZeroTier website and join each device to this network.</li>
  <li>Verify the connections by pinging between the connected devices.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Choosing the Right VPN</h4>
<p>
  All these VPN solutions are effective, but your choice may depend on factors like ease of use, existing familiarity, or specific features offered by each service. Netbird tends to be easier for quick setups, while Tailscale and ZeroTier offer robust configurations that might be preferable in complex network scenarios.
</p>

<h4>Test Connections</h4>
<pre>
<code>
# On the local system
ping SERVER_GCS_VPN_IP

# On the server
ping LOCAL_GCS_VPN_IP
</code></pre>
<p>
  Successful pings confirm a stable VPN connection. If pings fail, review your VPN settings or consult the respective support documentation for troubleshooting.
</p>


<h4>Using MAVLink Router</h4>

<p>
  MAVLink Router acts as middleware to forward MAVLink packets between different endpoints. In this setup, it is crucial for routing MAVLink data from your server GCS to your local GCS.
</p>
<h5>Why Use MAVLink Router?</h5>
<p>
  When drones are managed by a GCS on the server, the MAVLink data packets they generate are initially directed to that server-side GCS. To facilitate easier monitoring and control, you may want this data accessible on a local GCS. MAVLink Router enables this by routing the data packets to another GCS located on your local machine.
</p>
<h5>Installing MAVLink Router</h5>
<p>
  Before proceeding with the MAVLink routing, ensure that MAVLink Router is installed on the server. Follow these steps to install MAVLink Router:
</p>
<pre><code>
cd ~/mavsdk_drone_show
sudo bash tools/mavlink-router-install.sh
</code></pre>
<p>
  This script manages the installation process for MAVLink Router. Once the installation is complete, you can proceed with configuring the router.
</p>

<h5>Understanding the Command</h5>
<pre><code>
  mavlink-routerd -e LOCAL_GCS_VPN_IP:24550 0.0.0.0:34550
</code></pre>
<p>
  Here's what each parameter means:
  <ul>
    <li><code>-e LOCAL_GCS_VPN_IP:24550</code>: This specifies the endpoint where MAVLink messages will be forwarded. Replace "LOCAL_GCS_VPN_IP" with the VPN IP of your local machine. The port "24550" is where your local GCS listens for incoming MAVLink messages.</li>
    <li><code>0.0.0.0:34550</code>: This port on the server receives MAVLink messages from the drones. In this example, it's port "34550".</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h5>Ports Configuration</h5>
<p>
  In the given command, MAVLink messages are initially sent to port "34550" on the first GCS (server-side) and then routed to port "24550" on the second GCS (local). These port numbers can be adjusted in the "params.py" file according to your requirements.
</p>



<h4>QGroundControl Settings</h4>

<p>On your local GCS, open QGroundControl and navigate to &#39;Application Settings&#39; &gt; &#39;Comm Links&#39;. Create a new comm link, name it (e.g., &#39;server1&#39;), check the &#39;High Latency&#39; mode, set the connection type to &#39;UDP&#39;, set the port to &#39;24550&#39;, and optionally add the server (<code>SERVER_GCS_VPN_IP</code>). Save and select this comm link to connect. All your drones should now be auto-detected.</p>

<h2>Run Drone Instances</h2>
<p>
  Open a new terminal tab and SSH into your server:
</p>

<pre><code>
ssh root@Your_Server_IP
</code></pre>

<p>
  Once connected, navigate to the repository directory:
</p>

<pre><code>
cd ~/mavsdk_drone_show
</code></pre>

<p>
  Create the drone instances using the following script. This script now supports specifying a branch name for the simulations, allowing you to test different branches without affecting the main code base or real-world tests:
</p>

<pre><code>
sudo bash multiple_sitl/create_dockers.sh 2 sitl-test
</code></pre>

<p>
  The first argument specifies how many drone instances you want to create. In this example, "2" drones will be created. The second argument "sitl-test" specifies the branch name to be used for each Docker container. If no branch name is provided, the script defaults to the 'main' branch. This feature is particularly useful for testing new features or configurations in isolation from the main operational environment.
</p>

<p>
  Ensure your server has enough resources allocated for the drone instances you plan to run. The instances should automatically appear in your Portainer container list, where you can manage, monitor, and remove them as needed.
</p>
	    <h2>Clean-Up</h2>

<p>Once you are done, head over to the Portainer container menu and remove the drone instances you created. This will help save disk resources.</p>

<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>

<p>If you encounter any issues during this setup, here are some common troubleshooting steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ensure both the server and the local PC are connected to the same VPN network.</li>
	<li>Check the VPN admin interface to confirm that your devices are online.</li>
	<li>If pings are unsuccessful, verify firewall rules and consult VPN overlay provider documentation for network issues.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Congratulations, you've successfully set up a drone swarm SITL on a remote server! You're now able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Access the swarm dashboard</li>
    <li>Monitor ongoing missions</li>
    <li>Trigger new missions</li>
    <li>Upload and modify missions</li>
    <li>And much more!</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also interact with the drone swarm using any MAVLink-based ground control software on various platforms, giving you the flexibility to monitor or intervene in missions as needed.</p>
